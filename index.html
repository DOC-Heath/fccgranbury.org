	<h2>Come Alive In Christ</h2>
	<p>We support the way of the disciple and share the love of Christ with all.
	<h3>Prayer</h3>
	<h4>There’s no wrong way to pray…</h4>
	<p>
	We keep a list of concerns in and near our congregation that is published weekly in our newsletter and in our Sunday bulletin. If you would like to request prayers for yourself or a loved one, please call, text or email our church office (office@fccgranbury.org & 817-573-5431) or use the button below to submit a request online.

	</p>
	<h4>Prayer Concerns</h4>
	<h3>Study</h3>
	<p>We meet for seasonal Bible Studies as well as year round Sunday School classes. These classes are currently meeting:
	<h4>Disciples Class</h4><p>Sunday School with Russell Heil
	<h4>Christian’s Class</h4><p>Sunday School with Christian Piatt<p>This class meets every Sunday at 10 in the Parlor.
	<h4>Worship & Wonder</h4><p>Sunday School Class for Young Children
	<p>We also have periodic special Bible Studies. These are a couple of studies we’ve done in the past:
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXdHnXJHVPQ&list=PLIzXPqkTiuZ3WxKil1nrAe2w4TDieVDRN">The Gospel of Matthew</a></li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	<h3>Service</h3>
	<p>We maintain a database of opportunities for service, associated with the church and outside of it that our members participate in. Check back soon for more info! <a href="https://www.fccgranbury.org/mission-database">Launch beta version of mission database</a></p>
	<h3>Presence</h3>
	<h4>We love for you to share yourself with us, and we want to share ourselves with you…</h4>
	<p>Presence is so much more than just showing up on Sunday mornings.We are blessed to be in relationship with full members of our congregation who are homebound or live far away from Granbury. Our worship services are available to be watched online or can be mailed by CD to those who are unavailable to attend.</p>
	<h4>Experience the Love of Christ in Community</h4>
	<p>It can be hard to really get to know hundreds of people! And that’s why we want to make sure you have plenty of opportunity to form close connection in smaller groups. We value intergenerational friendships and can help you find your place here!</p>
	<h3>Generosity</h3>
	<h4>If you wish to donate financially to First Christian Church, there are several ways to do so:</h4>
	<ul>
	<li><h5><a href="https://fccgranbury.breezechms.com/give/online">GIVE ONLINE BY CREDIT, DEBIT, OR ACH</a></h5></li>
	<li><h5>SEND MAIL TO THE CHURCH</h5><p>We have a locking mailbox that we check daily at:<address>2109 W US Hwy 377<br>Granbury, TX 76048</address></p></li>
	<li><h5>OFFERING BOX IN THE SANCTUARY</h5><p>Our Sanctuary is available to you when the church office is open. You can use the offering box anytime.</p></li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Our View On Stewardship</h4>
	<p>Every year (usually in October) we have a stewardship campaign.
	<p>This is a time we challenge each person in our church to assess where they are in the 5 areas of discipleship (Prayer, Study, Service, Presence & Generosity).
	<p>Each of these is an opportunity to give: of our time, our love, and our financial resources.
	<p>Part of this season is filling out an annual pledge card. If you missed submitting your pledge in October, it’s never to late. There are some physical cards in the Narthex of the church, or you can pledge online.

	<h2>Children and Youth</h2>
	<p>FCC Loves Children and Youth! Learn more about our philosophy for our children’s ministries and resources available to your family.
	<h3>Infants & Toddlers</h3>
	<p>To support our parents with infants and toddlers, we have a mothers room and a staffed nursery available to 5 and under.
	<p>Children bring us so much joy! We invite them to join us in service, but if you prefer there are several options.
	<h4>Staffed Nursery for 5 & Under</h4>
	<p>
		Our nursery is staffed with trained individuals. You can enjoy worship knowing your children are in a safe environment. The link below will allow you to pre-register your child, or you can do so on Sunday mornings. Registration only needs to be completed one time per child, but can be updated anytime.
		<a href="https://fccgranbury.breezechms.com/form/5c2374">pre-register your child</a>
	</p>
	<h4>Mothers’ Room</h4>
	<p>Our new Mothers’ Room is located between the kitchen and childrens’ wing. Worship services are streamed into the room, and there are recliners, nursing pillows, a changing area, and baby bouncers/swings available. This room also has some parenting resources available, as well as “library” to take home or share baby equipment.
	<h4>Prayground</h4>
	<p>In our “Gathering Area” (where you’ll find coffee, donuts and more in the mornings) you’ll see a table and some shelves with toys appropriate for toddlers and young elementary-aged kids. Feel free to spend time here if your kids need a break from worship service. The service is streamed onto the TVs and there are some bibles/hymnals and games available as well!
	<h3>Children</h3>
	<p>Ages 3 through 1st grade can attend the Montessori-style Worship & Wonder. 2nd through 5th grades attend JYF where they study the fundamentals of our faith.
	<p>Our pre-school and elementary students are changing so quickly, and we love to see them learn and grow. We have organized faith programming as well as plenty of time for them to have fun and be kids. We love that our children LOVE being at church and many of them consider this to be where they’ve found their best friends.
	<h4>Children’s Worship & Wonder (Ages 3 to 7)</h4>
	<p>Worship & Wonder is a  holistic, montessori style program that uses storytelling, routine and fellowship to deepen children’s relationship with God. The children sing, hear a story, enjoy communion/”a feast”, and create together weekly. Everything there is guided by the childrens’ own understanding and wonder.
	<h4>Junior Youth Fellowship (JYF) (2nd Grade to 5th Grade)</h4>
	<p>This class lays the foundation for our older student programs, Chi-Rho and CYF. Here, students become more familiar with the bible and learn more about the fundamentals of Christian faith.
	<h3>Tweens & Teens</h3>
	<h3>Student Ministries</h3>
	<p>Our Chi-Rho program for middle schoolers and CYF program for high schoolers are where young disciples grow through love and service.
	<p>Our students are a full part of our congregation. Below, you will see special opportunities we have for them, but they are also involved in church leadership, volunteering with younger children, and developing their own spiritual practices.
	<h4>Chi-Rho</h4>
	<p>Chi-Rho is for junior high students. Quite often, they participate with the senior high students, but there are special camps and retreats for this age.
	<h4>Christian Youth Fellowship (CYF)</h4>
	<p>Our senior high students participate in CYF. There are a lot of service opportunities and they learn more in depth theology during Sunday School classes and Youth Group Wednesday Nights.

<h2>Testimonial</h2>
<p>FCC Granbury is an incredible, warm church full of some of the kindest people we have ever had the privilege to know. The love we have received from the FCC family has been overwhelming and just what we needed over the past year. The Alvarez Family</p>
<p>Always accepting and kind, even online. Community of friends sharing and teaching the love of Christ. The Ramsey Family</p>
<p>After joining First Christian Church in October of 2020, I've found kindness, acceptance, inclusion and welcome which is offered to all. All truly means ALL. We are a family yearning to love each other as Jesus loves us and we "draw the circle wide". Mary Juneau</p>
<p>We have been members for a long time, and have found a priceless community of friends who are like family here. Kenny & Kathy Martin</p>
<h2>LEARN MORE ABOUT US</h2>
<p>OUR MISSION: to share with ALL people the unconditional love of God that we experience in Jesus Christ our Lord</p>
<h3>OUR VISION</h3>
<p>Our vision is to be a church that helps people COME ALIVE IN CHRIST by inviting them to reimagine church with us:</p>
<p>Not pride and judgment, but a sanctuary for restoring the soul – humble people sharing radical hospitality, and loving each other beyond our differences.</p>
<p>Not easy answers, but growing together through shared engagement with the scriptures and the hard questions of life and faith.</p>
<p>Not a self-serving institution, but a community in the community that truly sees our neighbor and that responds with the relational love of Christ.</p>
